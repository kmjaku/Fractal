Fractal was created as school project.

Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop.

## Prerequisites

All libraries are included

## Installing

Clone in your terminal :

```
git clone https://github.com/kmjaku/Fractal.git ~/Fractal
cd ~/Fractol
make
```

Launch Fractal :

```
you can replace 'example' in next step by 1, 2 or 3.  1 is for the Fractal of MandelBrot, 2 is for Julia and 3 is for BurninShip
./fractol [example]
```

Enjoy
